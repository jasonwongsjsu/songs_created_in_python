# songs_created_in_python
This project was made by me, Dennis Outhavong, and Conrad Solarez of San Jose State University. Two tracks are made from scratch using Python: one ambient and club beat track. 

## Installation requirements
pydub, FFMPEG, and Thinkx must be installed before running scripts

## Instructions (after installation requirements have been fufilled)
Simply execute main.ipynb

Once again, special thanks to Allen B. Downey for Thinkx (https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkX) and James Robert for pydub (https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
